This is the second sample project for Diploma in AI featuring Text Classification & Generation as a NLP Deep Learning problem. Text classification involves categorizing text documents into predefined classes or categories, while text generation aims to generate coherent and meaningful text based on a given input.

By utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling, the project explores the effectiveness of these techniques in tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, or language translation.

Potential uses:
1.	Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing social media posts or customer reviews to determine sentiment towards products or services.
2.	Email Spam Detection: Classifying emails as spam or non-spam to improve email filtering systems.
3.	Language Translation: Translating text between different languages to facilitate communication across language barriers.

Learning outcomes:
1.	Understanding of LSTM networks and their ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data.
2.	Familiarity with Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling for tasks such as text generation or language translation.
3.	Proficiency in implementing text classification and text generation models using TensorFlow Keras API.

This project is prepared by Chen Yijie under the supervision of Zhou Changxin
